Text mining and search project README
--------------

Opening the Jupyter Notebook:
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file in an environment like Google Colab or JupyterLab.

Setting the Correct Directory:
- In the notebook, go to the "Extract Data" section.
- Set the directory path to where your 'blogs' data is stored.

Loading Data Using Pickle:
- Instead of running all code, you can load pre-processed data with pickle.
- This step is found at the end of the notebook, before changing 'age' to 'age_range'.
