The project, within the Text Mining and Search course, centers its attention on the analysis of the Blog Authorship Corpus, which comprises the accumulated posts of 19,320 bloggers sourced from blogger.com in August 2004. To facilitate data extraction and manipulation, the BeautifulSoup library is utilized for parsing XML files containing blog data. Additionally, the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library is employed for text preprocessing tasks on a list of blog posts. These preprocessing steps involve cleaning the text, tokenizing it, removing stop words and lemmatizing the remaining words.
