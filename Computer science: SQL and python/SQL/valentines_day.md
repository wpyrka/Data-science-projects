Dataset description: 
"In this dataset, we're exploring Valentine's Day survey data. The National Retail Federation in the United States conducts surveys and has created a Valentine's Day Data Center so you can explore the data on how consumers celebrate.

The NRF has surveyed consumers about how they plan to celebrate Valentine's Day annually for over a decade. Take a dive deeper into the data from the last 10 years, and explore the demographic breakdown of total spending, average spending, types of gifts planned, and spending per type of gift."
