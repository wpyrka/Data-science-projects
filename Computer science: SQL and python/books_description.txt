I imported a table from a CSV file into MySQL Workbench and then created a table containing the imported data. 
Subsequently, I split the table into two in order to enable myself to execute various queries and showcase the skills I acquired during the classes. 
I assigned primary keys to the appropriate columns, deleted columns that I did not use and renamed a few of them. 
Then, I proceeded to solve tasks.
