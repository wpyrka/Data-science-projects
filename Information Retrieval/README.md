The project, within the Information Retrieval course, focuses on developing a search engine. It employs essential text processing stages including stemming, stop word removal and case folding. Utilizing the NLTK library for natural language processing tasks and integrating regular expressions enhances text manipulation. The system facilitates search operations using BM25 and TF-IDF weighting models, ensuring efficient and interactive search functionality. The project was jointly developed with Paweł Mąsior and Kamila Fido.
