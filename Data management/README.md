The project, within the Data Management course, focuses on finding out the key determinants influencing the popularity of songs on Spotify. Specifically, the inquiry revolves around discerning the prevalent lexical, emotive and thematic elements within the top 50 Spotify songs of 2023 and elucidating their impact on audience engagement and song prominence. The primary focus of the project entails the procurement and analysis of three primary categories of data: song titles, lyrical content and comprehensive song metrics. The project was jointly developed with Kamila Fido and Jan Eljasiak.
