We, a consulting firm hired by a major client interested in F1 investments, conducted an analysis of races from 2011 to 2023 across global circuits. Our goal was to develop investment strategies tailored to the client’s objectives and budget. We visualized Constructors’ participation frequencies, added geographical data to Grand Prix events and calculated Average Speed and Fastest Lap Speed using circuit lengths. Challenges included selecting effective color combinations for visualizations and choosing appropriate icons. We used unconventional methods in Tableau Public, such as "rounded" bar charts and dynamic car compositions via URL actions. "The Vizards" group members: Weronika Pyrka, Robin Smith, Jan Eljasiak, Matteo Cernuto, Simone Lucia and Didar Orazgaliyev.
